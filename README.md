## Designing a Page Layout with HTML5 and CSS3 using Version Control

**Version Control Instructions**

This assignment will be your first attempt at a “group” project. You will be placed in teams of two (2) by your instructor. The purpose of working as a team is to reinforce what has been taught to you with respect to distributed version control and to simulate what you will face as an employee working in the industry. 

The assignment will be distributed via this repository to both parties involved. One of you will be the “branch manager” while one of you will be the lead developer. It goes without saying that you will both be developers; we just want a separation of titles for technical purposes. 

Although only the branch manager will “own” the master, both of you will be required to BRANCH off of the master to work on specific features. Although it may be tempting to have one person work on the HTML and one person work on the CSS, this will create problems. Without structure (HTML) you will have nothing for style rules (CSS) to apply to. To mitigate this issue, you will have to plan on who will work on what *portion* of each *document* at the same time. 

The best way to do this would be like this:

   •	Create your HTML document structure… that is pretty universal so it won’t create too many conflicts

   •	Use comments to explain your HTML document sections

   •	Once you have commented out the sections, then BRANCH

   •	Assign a certain number of sections to each developer or assign by name

    o	Just a tip: name your branch using your name with the type of work you are doing, this will prevent confusion later (ex = joe_index or mary_styles)

   •	Work closely together and communicate with one and other throughout the build process (YES THIS MEANS YOU HAVE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER!)


When you are confident that you have completed your tasks, submit a “Pull Request” to your branch manager to merge your branch back in with the MASTER. The branch manager will then merge your code into the MASTER. 

The branch manager should do a pull request of your branch into master not the other way around. DO NOT manually merge a branch into master yourself as that will likely create conflicts.

GitHub checks for conflicts before it allows you to accept a pull request, so that issue should be mitigated by the software.
